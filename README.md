## 📌 Project Overview

**Hotel Review Explorer** is an interactive GUI for browsing and comparing hotels using real review data.  
We focus on efficient searching and ranking using two data structures:

- **Trie** → enables fast hotel name search with autocomplete
- **Heaps** → used to quickly retrieve top-rated and lowest-rated hotels


### What You Can Do in the GUI
- Search for hotels by name
- View each hotel's:
  - **Average Rating**
  - **Highest Rating** + corresponding review
  - **Lowest Rating** + corresponding review
- Browse rankings:
  - **Top Overall Rated Hotels**
  - **Top Highest Individual Review Scores**
  - **Top Lowest Individual Review Scores**

### Goal
- The purpose is to make hotel review data **easy to explore and compare**, providing a clean UI, quick searching, and interesting rankings.

## 🛠️ SETUP

This project uses **Dear ImGui** and **GLFW** for our GUI. 
Both dependencies are already included locally in the repository so you don't need to install anything.

### Step 1: Clone the project
Can remove last line once we push to main
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kylwein/Hotel-Review-Explorer-COP3530-.git
cd Hotel-Review-Explorer-COP3530-
git checkout Implementing-GUI-+-Tries
```
### Step 2: Verify Folders
Make sure your project root has these folders:
``` 
Hotel-Review-Explorer-COP3530-
├── imgui/
├── glfw/
├── main.cpp
├── Trie.cpp
├── HeapSort.cpp
└── CMakeLists.txt
```
### Step 3: Dependency Setup (Optional)
If you are missing dependencies run this in powershell:
```powershell
if (!(Test-Path "./imgui")) { git clone https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git }
if (!(Test-Path "./glfw")) {
  $u="https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/download/3.4/glfw-3.4.bin.WIN64.zip"
  Invoke-WebRequest $u -OutFile "g.zip"
  Expand-Archive "g.zip" .
  Rename-Item "glfw-3.4.bin.WIN64" "glfw"
  Remove-Item "g.zip"
}
```

### Step 4: Build & Run
```
1) Open the folder in IDE
2) Reload CMake Project
3) Build
4) Run (the GUI will open automatically)
```

## ⚙️ Implementation
**Data Structures**
- **Trie:**  
  - Stores hotel names, tags, and keywords  
  - Enables fast prefix-based autocomplete — O(n) time, where *n* = string length  
- **Heap (Min/Max):**  
  - Ranks hotels by ratings
  - Maintains top-N efficiently in O(log n) time  

**Workflow**
1. Load and preprocess dataset  
2. Insert hotel/review data into Trie for lookup  
3. Build Heaps for ranking/filtering  
4. Integrate GUI — user searches → Trie finds matches → Heap ranks → display results
